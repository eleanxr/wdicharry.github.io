I am attempting to start a blog to keep track of notes, discoveries, things I
find interesting and whatever else may enter my stream of consciousness while I
work, play, hobby, or space out. Hopefully, this will be a fruitful effort and
worth my time. I've always wanted to have a programming blog where I can keep
track of things I find out while I work on my projects. I may fizzle out, but
we'll see what happens. I decided now was the time to start because I'm working
on a project to install [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org) on an old
smartphone I have laying around to make it into something like an iPod touch,
and I'm coming across a number of problems with the build process that need
solving, so it seems like a good way to take notes about that.  Hopefully I'll
at least make at least one post about that :-) 

Anyway, on to topics. Quickly, why I chose [GitHub](http://github.com),
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and [Git](http://git-scm.com) for this platform:

* I'm a programmer. If I just throw something up on blogspot, that would feel like quitting.
* I think Git is the best thing to happen to content management since [Vi](http://www.vim.org) (yes I know that's Vim...).
* On that note, I get to use Vi to edit my posts.
* I intend to talk about code on this blog, and the markdown supported by Jekyll is great for that.
* Oh, and LaTeX too!
* I own my content. If I decide to move away from GitHub for hosting, it's easy, I can just clone my repo somewhere else.
* Did I mention I like Git?

Now back to my project. I think I've got a WebKit build error to deal with now...
